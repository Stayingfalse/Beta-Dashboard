This is a Next.js project with both frontend and backend (API routes) running in a single Docker container. Use environment variables for MariaDB connection. All code should be compatible with containerized deployment.
Any changes you make you should tick up the version number in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) for version numbers. Also tick this version in the default footer added to layout.tsx
